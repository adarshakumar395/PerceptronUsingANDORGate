A Perceptron is an Artificial Neuron. It is the simplest possible Neural Network. Neural Networks are the building blocks of Machine Learning.
A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron that takes in multiple inputs, applies weights to each input, sums them up, and passes the result through an activation function to produce an output.
